# Methodology

The Healthy Connecticut 2025: State Health Assessment was
ultimately guided by Connecticut’s vision for health equity. The
health indicators selected to be presented in the assessment
reflect the social determinants of health that are impacting
residents and highlight where health is experienced differently
based on geographic or demographic characteristics.

The development of this assessment incorporated the Mobilizing
for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) framework
and Public Health Accreditation Board (PHAB) standards and
measures. A cross-disciplinary team of internal and external
stakeholders was engaged to develop a vision for Healthy
Connecticut 2025 and to prioritize a list of health indicators for
inclusion in the report. In addition, community members were
provided opportunities to contribute to the development of
the assessment through surveys and focus groups, and finally
through a public comment period.

### Assets and Resources

As CT DPH teams gathered and analyzed data for the assessment,
they also compiled a list of programmatic and state-wide
assets. Additionally, through an analysis of local community
health assessments and hospital health needs assessments,
and partner input, community assets were added to develop a
comprehensive list. A high level description of community assets
and resources is available in Appendix B. A more detailed
listing of identified assets, including the analysis of the local
community health and hospital health assessments is contained
in a companion document “Assets and Resources” available on
the Coalition website. This document will serve as a dynamic
and continuously updated resource for mapping assets to
intentionally developed collaborative strategies. 

## Kinds of Data Presented in the Assessment

The State Health Assessment presents many kinds of data visualized in graphs,
tables, and maps. Here are some examples of data types included in this report
and what they mean.

Please note we can do much prettier tables in code, and in fact
I'll insist on it, but for demonstration purposes, we'll use straight markdown.

| Census     |  How many people are/ have ____?  |    An official count   |

## Connecticut Maps

Maps are presented in infographic style throughout the report. Below are three reference maps of Connecticut’s counties and towns
(1); its major highways and cities (2); and major waterways (3).
