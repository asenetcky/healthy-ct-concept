# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This is a website for showcasing how the state can adopt to using markdown,
quarto and the Open Data Portal (ODP) to streamline the State Health Assessment
creation process allowing for more timely releases and in turn providing
stakeholders with greater agency and the ability to act on the information
housed therein.

This concept will be *deliberately* using the same or similiar language from
the 2025 Health Assessment for ease of comparison. This meant to be a vertical
slice of the 2025 Health Assessment, showcasing a little bit of everything.
