    "text": "Letter from the Commissioner\nTo Our Residents and Public Health Partners:\nThe Connecticut Department of Public Health is pleased to present the Healthy Connecticut 2025 State Health Assessment. Subject matter experts from the Connecticut Department of Public Health (CT DPH), in collaboration with other state agencies, statewide partners and community organizations, have assembled data reflecting on the health and safety of Connecticut residents. The last such document was published in 2014.\nThe State Health Assessment establishes the health status of the state, and will inform the prioritization and development of the next Healthy Connecticut 2025 State Health Improvement Plan (SHIP). This plan will serve as a 5-year roadmap for promoting and advancing population health in our State. Statewide partners from the Connecticut Health Improvement Coalition, along with CT DPH, will begin the collaborative development of the SHIP in January 2020.\nWhile Connecticut is a healthy state overall, this assessment highlights the challenges faced around achieving health equity for all our residents. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that health equity is achieved when every person has the opportunity to “attain his or her full health potential” and no one is “disadvantaged from achieving this potential because of social position or other socially determined circumstances.” CT DPH is committed to enhancing health equity for our state; this document is an affirmation that equitable access to healthcare and addressing those social conditions that impact health is a basic human right.\nThe Healthy Connecticut 2025 initiative will focus on making the connection between social determinants and health outcomes. To experience success with these efforts we must prioritize examining the impact of social, behavioral and environmental factors on health to better inform policies and promote systemic change, while exploring collaborative place-based initiatives with our municipal and local health partners. It is our hope that we continue to work together to address the needs of Connecticut residents and afford every single person the opportunity to be as healthy as possible.\nWe look forward to collaborating with you in the future on this important work.\nSincerely,\nJ. Smith Commish, MD, MPH\nActing Commissioner",

The assessment provides the basis for the Connecticut State Health Improvement Plan, which together make up the state health planning framework Healthy Connecticut 2025.\nThe purpose of the assessment is to provide the public, policy leaders, partners, and stakeholders with information on the health of the Connecticut population to develop a shared understanding of health issues and inform data-driven decision making and program planning. This state health assessment is an important tool to help identify the underlying conditions and factors that influence health, reflect on existing services and policies, and inform future public health planning for the benefit of all Connecticut communities.",

    "text": "1.3 Methodology\nThe Healthy Connecticut 2025: State Health Assessment was ultimately guided by Connecticut’s vision for health equity. The health indicators selected to be presented in the assessment reflect the social determinants of health that are impacting residents and highlight where health is experienced differently based on geographic or demographic characteristics.\nThe development of this assessment incorporated the Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) framework and Public Health Accreditation Board (PHAB) standards and measures. A cross-disciplinary team of internal and external stakeholders was engaged to develop a vision for Healthy Connecticut 2025 and to prioritize a list of health indicators for inclusion in the report. In addition, community members were provided opportunities to contribute to the development of the assessment through surveys and focus groups, and finally through a public comment period.\n\n1.3.1 Engagement Process\nNulla eget cursus ipsum.

Additionally, through an analysis of local community health assessments and hospital health needs assessments, and partner input, community assets were added to develop a comprehensive list. A high level description of community assets and resources is available in Appendix B. A more detailed listing of identified assets, including the analysis of the local community health and hospital health assessments is contained in a companion document “Assets and Resources” available on the Coalition website. This document will serve as a dynamic and continuously updated resource for mapping assets to intentionally developed collaborative strategies.",

    "text": "In order to fully understand the state of Connecticut’s health and health outcomes, it is imperative for this State Health Assessment to begin by describing our residents by those fundamental sociodemographics that contribute to certain populations experiencing a greater burden of ill health; the difference in these health outcomes on a population level are health disparities. The World Health Organization states that “what makes societies prosper and flourish can also make people healthy.” At a glance it would appear that Connecticut is doing well from a national perspective; America’s Health Rankings 2018 Annual Report reported that Connecticut is the third healthiest state in the country. But even when our society thrives there continue to be pockets of our people who experience worse health outcomes solely because they identify or pertain to historically underrepresented groups based on but not exclusive to sex and sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, or age.\n\nIdentifying who is at greatest risk for preventable health conditions is an important initial step toward identifying relevant health inequities and supporting health equity. And while these populations are defined by elements that are immutable, there are other populations of interest — immigrants and refugees, veterans, the formerly incarcerated, and people with mental health disorders — who also experience poor health outcomes disparately. Although the 2018 America’s Health Rankings Annual Report found that Connecticut is the third healthiest state in the nation, we must consider that it is also the most diverse state in New England; this greater diversity indicates a need for greater resources in order to respond more equitably. Each of these presents a different aspect of meeting the health needs of our communities, from having a competent and diverse workforce to removing language barriers.\nEtiam non efficitur urna, quis elementum nisi.

Yet education can provide individuals with foundational knowledge, life skills, and social and psychological supports to make healthier choices. Therefore, quality education and higher educational attainment can be a protective factor that can advance more equitable outcomes.3 It has been demonstrated that individuals without a high school diploma have higher incidences of risk behaviors and other adverse health outcomes; and earn less money, which can limit access to resources and healthy environments.4",
